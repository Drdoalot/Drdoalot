- 👋 Hi, I’m @Drdoalot
- 👀 I’m interested in videogames, table top, astronomy/rocket science, martial arts, working out and all other things nerdy.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning to develop games, and want to start a career as a gamedev. The skills I've developed so far include C++, C#, Java Unity, and a little Blender.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any game development related project, I'll take any opportunity to learn more about how games are coded.
- 📫 How to reach me: twitter.com/drdoa_lot, drdoalot123@gmail.com, Drdoalot#6666 on Discord.
